## Git vs. GitHub

Git: Is a version control system that runs in the command line that a system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. Such as editing, removing, renaming and etc. One of the biggest different is that Git can be used without having Github.

GitHub: Is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. Saving all your code in the CLoud. This tool is very useful during collaborate with other coders, this tool also let you be able to interact with other Repositories and be able to see the changes of their project. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. Plus Github _does_ require GIt.

2. There will be a **'SIGN UP'** link in the top right corner of the Main Page
3. There you will bring to a page that will let you enter your username, passwords and email.

## Workflow & Commands
There are many Git workflows out there. A Git Workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. Git offers a lot of flexibility in how users manage changes. Given Git's focus on flexibility, there is no standardized process on how to interact with Git.

## Rolling Back Changes
Even the fastest coders do make some mistakes, and that's okay! But if you made a mistake and don't know how to fix it? Don't worry!
1. ALWAYS READ YOUR CODE BEFORE CONFIRMING ANYTHING!
2. Even when you add an extra/miss a letter, you can retype the code again
3. But if you want to rename a file, you can used mv ,but you need to be outside of your file in order to do any renaming

If there's anything you want to remove the file and everything in the file itself, you can used ( rm -rf )
