## Git vs. GitHub

Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them

## Rolling Back Changes
Even the fastest coders do make some mistakes, and that's okay! But if you made a mistake and don't know how to fix it? Don't worry!
1. ALWAYS READ YOUR CODE BEFORE CONFIRMING ANYTHING!
2. Even when you add an extra/miss a letter, you can retype the code again
3. But if you want to rename a file, you can used mv ,but you need to be outside of your file in order to do any renaming

If there's anything you want to remove the file and everything in the file itself, you can used ( rm -rf )
